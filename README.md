# GuiEncryption
 Small Gui tool that encrypt files using AES et keys using RSA

V 0.1 
Allow you to encrypt data using aes128, a random keys  is generated then encrypted with rsa.
The tool can create RSA keys or you can  load your own but it only accept xml format.

The tools work but it will crash if u don't provide the right asked file (ex if u give pub key instead of private, etc.)
I'll fixe it later.

Hope it help
